//lets talk about the comparisions in jS 
console.log(2>1);
console.log(423<232);   // here in this Js will show this result in BOOlean form (True or false)
console.log(2>=4); 
//  what will be the problem if i do comparisions will be on 
console.log("2">1)   // here the JS will automatically convert "2" into integer 
console.log(null > 0)
console.log( null<=0);


// This second type of coversion are not preferable 
  //we should know the best comparision is done by "===" and here in this it also checks if the input datatype are same or not 
  //for example 
  console.log("5"===2);
